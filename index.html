        <title>Sun and moon sky traces</title>
    </head>

    <body>

        <p>This website shows the sun and moon positions in the sky at Halifax,
        Nova Scotia, for the present day.  The outer circle represents the
        horizon, and letters indicate (true, not magnetic) directions North,
        East, etc.  The vertical and horizontal lines intersect at the zenith,
        i.e. the point directly overhead.  The sun trajectory is drawn in red,
        while blue is used for the moon.  The numbers indicate the hours of the
        day, in a 24-hour clock set to local standard time (that is, not taking
        any account of daylight-savings time shifts).</p>

        <p>R code to create this graph and others like it is
        provided in the <code>sunmoon4Halifax.R</code> script,
        which is available at <a href="https://github.com/dankelley/sunmoon">GitHub</a>.
        If you would like to explore the variation at other times of the year,
        or at different locations, type
        <pre style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dankelley/sunmoon/master/sun_moon_app.R")
shinyApp(ui, server)
        </pre> in an R or RStudio window, and then use the slider and pulldown
        menus.  (You must first install the R packages <code>shiny</code> and
        <code>oce</code>, for this to work.) If you would like to have another
        location added to the pull-down menu, please feel free to email me at
        <code>dan.kelley@dal.ca</code> and I will add your suggestion.</p>
